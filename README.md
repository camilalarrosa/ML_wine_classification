# ML_wine_classification

Machine learning model that learned to classify wine as red or white based on 12 of its parameters like pH, density, etc.

Dataset available on: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dell4010/wine-dataset

NOTE: 

  In file 1 I test 7 of the main models for ML classification, then I tune the two best results and finally, I present the final, improved model. This is a complete file where you can observe this process of trying and choosing various algorithms.

  In file 2, I present the chosen model directly, with the best parameters obtained. It is a faster and easier file to understand the main objective of the project: a model that can predict the classification of wines.
